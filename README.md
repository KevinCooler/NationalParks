National Parks Web Application

This is a full stack web application developed so that the user can:
    1. View a list of all national parks from the home page.
    2. Select a park to view more detailed information.
    3. View a 5 day weather forecast and receive suggestions for how to prepare.
    4. Change the units of the temperature display and have the choice remembered for the rest of the time browsing the website.
    5. Participate in a daily survey.
    6. View the results of the survey.

This application is written in Java using the Spring Web MVC framework. 
I implemented form validation and dynamic break points to create a responsive user experience. 
I Integrated JUnit and Selenium frameworks to create a full coverage testing suite.
This application queries from and modifies a SQL database. 

The application utulized a Tomcat server.
